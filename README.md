# codingJourney

*A blog which describes our journey to become coding heroes.*

We are a group of people who met at Founders and Coders in June 2016 to learn about version control and Git/GitHub.

This is our first group project using Git and GitHub. 

Below are some guidance notes to keep our repository clean: 

- It would be good if we worked on individual branches to make our commits. These can be later merged to the master branch through pull requests. 

- The purpose of the project is to create a blog website that will contain posts by different people discussing their preferred resources to learn to code or generally improve their web development skills. 

- Although the structure and look of the website are important, the main objective of this exercise is to get familiar with version control both on our PC (through Git) and online (through GitHub). As a starting point, the project could start with a HTML file and a CSS file. Any interactivity using JavaScript is also welcome.

- Target completion date: end of August 2016.
